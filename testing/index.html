		<h1>Welcome to Vorlage.</h1>
		<p>The Vorlage team at Ellem really apprecieate your adoption
			of the Vorlage Webengine. We strive to make the Vorlage
			the best webengine out there, but we cannot do it without
			you!</p>
		<p>Please note that the nature of Vorlage is not very friendly
		to those newer to software development, this is only because
		Vorlage is in the earlier stages of development and some
		things still need to be figured out until we start writting
		fancy manuals and help guides outside the specification.</p>

		<h1>Testing Form</h1>
		<p>When first set up, Vorlage comes with a testproc, a
		processor that is met for testing things. Below is a form you
			can submit to see the behaviour of testproc.</p>
		<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
			<p>
				<label>logme (upon submission, look at the logs)</label>
				<input type="text" name="logme">
			</p>
			<p>
				<label>logmestream (upon submission, look at the response headers and you'll see that testproc set an error)</label>
				<input type="file" name="logmestream">
			</p>
			<p>
				<label>echotext</label>
				<input type="text" name="echotext">
			</p>
			<p><input type="submit"></p>
			<p>Output of test.echo: <pre>$(test.echo)</pre></p>
		</form>
